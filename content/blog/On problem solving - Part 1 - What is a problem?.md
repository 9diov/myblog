## Motivation

Over the years, I’ve noticed something—both in my own work and through conversations with others: problem-solving is one of those skills that’s quietly essential, yet often underdeveloped. We all face problems daily, whether in tech, business, or everyday life. But very few of us have taken the time to study how we actually approach those problems systematically.

This series of posts is my personal attempt to help with that. Creating a general guide on problem-solving is hard as a lot of problem-solving is domain-specific. Yet I believe having a solid, general foundation of understanding about the problem-solving process and frameworks is very helpful.

## What is a problem?

It seems obvious that something is a problem when we face it in real life, but can we provide a precise definition of a problem?
 
What exactly is a **problem**? Simply put, a problem is a gap between a "perceived reality" and an "expected reality".
