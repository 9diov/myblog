title: "About me"
---

Programmer, engineering manager, co-founder and avid reader from Vietnam.

I am a programming language nerd, learned and tried many programming languages across different paradigms. At work, I helped my engineering team to work on [AMQL](https://docs.holistics.io/as-code/amql/), a pair of configuration and query languages that is the core technology of our flagship product.

While working as a co-founder of Holistics, I learned business strategy and management to help building the vision and strategy for the company.

As an engineering manager, I worked on teaching our team members the basics of problem solving, technical writing, software design, coaching, and a few other skills.

I have a broad interest in the topic of building software as tools for thoughts, the "bicycle of the mind".

For personal improvement, I studied a bit of Buddhism, Taoism and Stoicism. These provide useful perspectives and practices for me to deal with the difficulties of life.
